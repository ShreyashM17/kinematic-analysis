# Kinematic Analysis of Slider-Crank Mechanism

## Overview

This Python script performs kinematic analysis of a **slider-crank mechanism**, calculating and visualizing key motion parameters such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration for both the **slider (piston)** and **connecting rod**.  

The results are plotted to show their variation with the **crank angle**.

## Features

- Computes **slider displacement, velocity, and acceleration**.
- Computes **connecting rod angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration**.
- Plots:
  - Velocity vs. Crank Angle for the Slider (Piston)
  - Acceleration vs. Crank Angle for the Slider (Piston)
  - Velocity vs. Crank Angle for the Connecting Rod
  - Acceleration vs. Crank Angle for the Connecting Rod

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
